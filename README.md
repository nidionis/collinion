Inspired by Dimitri Collignon, Here some of his (musical) work:
  - KanDi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtM9G354OAw🚡
  - Charlotte NARTZ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngixp7VVpNY
  - Dr. K. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Finzub0FzHA

at least running in a terminal:

or ./run examples/<fileOfYourChoice>
or ./run -h for such an helpfull message

or ./run rules.py

### ADVERTISEMENT: Modifying rules.py is adictive
