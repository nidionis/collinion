Inspired by Dimitri Collignon, Here some of his (musical) work:
  - KanDi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtM9G354OAwðŸš¡
  - Charlotte NARTZ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ngixp7VVpNY
  - Dr. K. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Finzub0FzHA
  - Own Blow https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsQjYpATXG1AHtzDS2i60Gg

at least running in a terminal:

    python3 run.py
  
can be satisfying

### ADVERTISEMENT: Modifying rules.py is adictive

Next features for a V1.0:
- better managment of borders
- zoom / speed (there is something already using right/left arrows)
- a tutorial

Let me know if it does not compile straight away on your system please
